# My Frontend Setup for MacOS

This repo is inspired by Dries Vints' awesome [blog post](https://driesvints.com/blog/getting-started-with-dotfiles) and [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles).

## Beginner's guide

If you're a beginner to setup, I wrote a blog post with an intro to the shell, the basic utilities and config files involved in the frontend setup process. I've also commented on the purpose of each of the scripts in the files.

## Setup

Clone this repo into your home directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alizehkhan/dotfiles.git

*‚ö†Ô∏è Please don't run other people's scripts blindly. Stay safe.*

```shell
source ~/dotfiles/install.sh
```

Grab a cuppa ‚òïÔ∏è and wait for the scripts to finish running ‚úÖ.
